# Stale Property NOTIFY Fix — Design

**Status:** approved, ready for implementation plan
**Issue:** #17 (SmartShift button press does not update UI)
**Target release:** whatever beta comes after `v0.3.1-beta.1`, not a dedicated release
**Author:** Mina Maher (brainstormed with Claude)
**Date:** 2026-04-19

## Summary

Hardware-originated state changes (physical SmartShift button press, DPI
cycle button press, scroll invert change from another app) don't
propagate to QML bindings. Properties read stale values until the next
profile reload.

Two layers to fix:

1. **Signal plumbing.** Give `PhysicalDevice` per-property relay signals,
   have `DeviceModel` forward them (gated on the selected device) to the
   Q_PROPERTY NOTIFY signals that already exist but are never emitted.
   Flip the Q_PROPERTY NOTIFYs from the coarse `settingsReloaded` to the
   property-specific signals.

2. **Display-cache invalidation.** `DeviceModel` getters like
   `smartShiftEnabled()` currently return `m_display*` (the active
   profile's cached values, set by `setDisplayValues`) whenever
   `m_hasDisplayValues == true`. After the first profile loads, this is
   true forever, so even when QML re-reads, the getter returns the stale
   profile value instead of the live session state. Fix: when a hardware
   state change arrives on the selected device, set
   `m_hasDisplayValues = false`. Getters fall through to
   `session->smartShiftEnabled()` etc. The next profile reload (focus
   change, profile switch, explicit reload) re-populates the cache via
   `setDisplayValues`.

## Scope

Fix the live UI for these properties:

- `smartShiftEnabled`
- `smartShiftThreshold`
- `scrollHiRes`
- `scrollInvert`
- `thumbWheelMode`
- `thumbWheelInvert`
- `currentDPI`

All share the same latent bug: Q_PROPERTY NOTIFY points at
`settingsReloaded`, which only fires on a full profile reload, so
hardware-originated changes don't reach QML. `currentDPI` became
particularly visible after v0.3.1-beta.1 shipped the `dpi-cycle` action
that writes DPI outside any profile-reload path.

Out of scope:
- `batteryLevel` / `batteryCharging`: already have a dedicated
  `selectedBatteryChanged` NOTIFY; work correctly.
- `activeSlot` / Easy-Switch host state: same staleness class, but
  mentioned in MX Vertical's beta-tester checklist; wait for confirmation
  before expanding scope.
- `ActionModel` capability filtering: issue #63, separate track.

## Root cause

Two layered issues.

### Layer 1: display-values cache shadows live state

`DeviceModel::smartShiftEnabled()` (line 441, mirrored for DPI / threshold
/ scroll / thumb-wheel) starts with:

```cpp
if (m_hasDisplayValues) return m_displaySmartShiftEnabled;
```

`m_hasDisplayValues` is flipped to `true` inside `setDisplayValues` (line
665), which is called from `AppController::onDisplayProfileChanged`
every time the active per-app profile changes. After the first profile
loads, `m_hasDisplayValues` stays `true`, so the getter returns the
cached *profile* value forever. Hardware changes from the device side
can fire any number of signals; the getter never sees them.

### Layer 2: signal chain stops at refreshRow

Even ignoring Layer 1, the signal chain today:

```
DeviceSession                     PhysicalDevice                  DeviceModel
=============                     ==============                  ===========
HID++ notify arrives
  -> m_smartShiftEnabled = ...
  -> emit smartShiftChanged()  ─► connected lambda:
                                  emit stateChanged()           ─► connected lambda:
                                                                    refreshRow(device)
                                                                    (updates QAbstractListModel
                                                                     roles only; no
                                                                     Q_PROPERTY NOTIFY
                                                                     signals fire)
```

`DeviceModel::refreshRow` updates the carousel's `data()` roles for that
row (battery chip, connection indicator) but doesn't emit any
per-property change signal. Q_PROPERTY bindings in QML are attached to
signals like `settingsReloaded` (fired only on profile reload), so
hardware-originated changes don't trigger a re-read.

All the specific signals declared on `DeviceModel`
(`smartShiftEnabledChanged`, `smartShiftThresholdChanged`,
`scrollConfigChanged`, `thumbWheelModeChanged`, `currentDPIChanged`)
exist but are never emitted.

Note that `refreshRow` already emits `settingsReloaded` on the selected
row path (line 245). So today's QML bindings on `NOTIFY
settingsReloaded` *do* get pinged on hardware change. They re-read the
getter and still see the stale cached profile value because of Layer 1.
This is why fixing only the signal plumbing (as the original issue
diagnosis suggests) is insufficient.

## Design

### Signal flow after the fix

```
DeviceSession                     PhysicalDevice                  DeviceModel
=============                     ==============                  ===========
emit smartShiftChanged(e, t)   ─► lambda emits BOTH:
                                    emit smartShiftChanged(e, t)─► onPhysicalSmartShiftChanged:
                                    emit stateChanged()             if device == selectedDevice():
                                                                      emit smartShiftEnabledChanged()
                                                                      emit smartShiftThresholdChanged()
                                                                    (refreshRow still fires via
                                                                     the existing stateChanged
                                                                     handler so the carousel
                                                                     updates regardless)
```

### Gating rule

DeviceModel only emits a property NOTIFY when the change is on the
currently selected device. A background mouse's HID++ traffic (battery
tick, host change) still updates its carousel row via
`refreshRow(device)`, but does NOT pulse QML bindings that read the
selected device's state. This avoids spurious re-renders and matches
the existing `selectedBatteryChanged` pattern used for battery.

Selection change (a different mouse becomes selected) is already
handled by `selectedChanged` on the properties that care; swapping the
selected device re-evaluates everything on both QML sides.

### Cache-invalidation rule (Layer 1)

The per-property handler in `DeviceModel` does **both** things when the
change is on the selected device:

1. Sets `m_hasDisplayValues = false`.
2. Emits the matching per-property NOTIFY signal(s).

After step 1, the getters (`smartShiftEnabled()`, `currentDPI()`, etc.)
stop returning the cached `m_display*` values and fall through to
`session->smartShiftEnabled()` and the other live session readers. QML
bindings re-read and see the hardware's current value.

`setDisplayValues` re-sets `m_hasDisplayValues = true` as it does today,
so the next profile reload (focus change, profile switch) cleanly
re-populates the cache and restores profile-shaped semantics. No other
call site touches `m_hasDisplayValues`.

## Code surface

Six files, no new files.

### `src/core/DeviceSession.{h,cpp}`

Audit the existing emit points and add any missing ones so every property
in scope has a session-level change notification:

- `currentDPIChanged()` must fire from `setDPI` (after the HID++ ack
  lands in `m_currentDPI`) and from any external-origin HID++
  notification that updates `m_currentDPI`. If not already emitted,
  add it.
- `thumbWheelInvertChanged()` must fire when `setThumbWheelInvert` (or
  equivalent) writes the flag. Add the signal if it is not declared;
  add the emit.
- `smartShiftChanged(bool, int)` already exists; no change.
- `scrollConfigChanged()` already exists; no change.
- `thumbWheelModeChanged()` already exists; no change.

Narrow unit tests in `tests/test_device_session.cpp` cover any newly
added emit points. No changes to existing signals' parameter shapes.

### `src/core/PhysicalDevice.h`

Add these signals alongside the existing `stateChanged`:

```cpp
void smartShiftChanged(bool enabled, int threshold);
void scrollConfigChanged();
void thumbWheelModeChanged();
void thumbWheelInvertChanged();
void currentDPIChanged();
```

Parameter shapes mirror DeviceSession's corresponding signals so the
lambda relay can forward arguments directly.

### `src/core/PhysicalDevice.cpp`

Update `connectSessionSignals`: every existing lambda that currently
only emits `stateChanged` also emits the matching per-property signal.
Add one new connection for `DeviceSession::currentDPIChanged` (and
`thumbWheelInvertChanged` if that is a new DeviceSession signal).

Shape:

```cpp
connect(session, &DeviceSession::smartShiftChanged, this,
        [this](bool enabled, int threshold) {
    emit smartShiftChanged(enabled, threshold);
    emit stateChanged();
});
```

The order matters only in the sense that both must fire; `refreshRow`
re-reads all data roles regardless, so there is no risk of the carousel
lagging behind the Q_PROPERTY read.

`disconnectSessionSignals` already uses a blanket
`disconnect(session, nullptr, this, nullptr)`, so no changes there.

### `src/app/models/DeviceModel.h`

Add a declaration for `thumbWheelInvertChanged()` in the `signals:` block
(mirror the existing `thumbWheelModeChanged`). All other signals already
exist.

Flip the Q_PROPERTY NOTIFY declarations:

```cpp
Q_PROPERTY(int currentDPI          READ currentDPI          NOTIFY currentDPIChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool smartShiftEnabled  READ smartShiftEnabled   NOTIFY smartShiftEnabledChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int smartShiftThreshold READ smartShiftThreshold NOTIFY smartShiftThresholdChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool scrollHiRes        READ scrollHiRes         NOTIFY scrollConfigChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool scrollInvert       READ scrollInvert        NOTIFY scrollConfigChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(QString thumbWheelMode  READ thumbWheelMode      NOTIFY thumbWheelModeChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool thumbWheelInvert   READ thumbWheelInvert    NOTIFY thumbWheelInvertChanged)
```

`scrollHiRes` and `scrollInvert` share `scrollConfigChanged` because
they change together in `setScrollConfig`. Two NOTIFYs firing on the
same signal is valid Qt.

### `src/app/models/DeviceModel.cpp`

In `addPhysicalDevice` (the same method that already connects
`stateChanged` around line 146), add five new `connect` calls that wire
the new PhysicalDevice signals to small handler lambdas. Each handler:

1. Early-returns if `device != selectedDevice()`.
2. Sets `m_hasDisplayValues = false` so the getters stop shadowing the
   live session state with the cached profile value.
3. Emits the matching DeviceModel signal(s). For `smartShiftChanged`
   this is both `smartShiftEnabledChanged()` and
   `smartShiftThresholdChanged()`. For `scrollConfigChanged` nothing
   needs to happen inside the handler beyond re-emit because both
   affected Q_PROPERTYs share that NOTIFY.

`refreshRow(device)` keeps running via the existing `stateChanged`
connection; no duplicate call from the per-property handlers.

Keep `settingsReloaded` untouched. It stays as the coarse "reloaded
from profile" signal that still fires on profile reload paths, and
still serves as the NOTIFY for properties that have no other trigger
(nothing in the current in-scope set, but useful to leave in place for
future `activeProfileName` / similar bindings).

### `src/app/AppController.cpp`

No changes. The request signals (`smartShiftChangeRequested` etc.) keep
their existing wiring from DeviceModel to DeviceManager.

## Tests

All new tests go under `tests/test_device_model.cpp` (existing). No new
test files. Framework is the existing GTest + QSignalSpy setup.

### Gate tests

Use a test fixture with two `MockDevice` / `PhysicalDevice` pairs, one
selected. For each property in scope:

- **SelectedDeviceEmits**: spy on the DeviceModel signal, simulate the
  PhysicalDevice's per-property emit on the selected device, assert
  exactly one DeviceModel emission.
- **UnselectedDeviceDoesNotEmit**: same spy, same simulation on the
  *other* PhysicalDevice, assert zero DeviceModel emissions.
- **UnselectedDeviceStillRefreshesRow**: assert that `rowChanged`
  (the QAbstractListModel signal) fires on both selected and
  unselected devices so the carousel stays in sync regardless.

### Cache-invalidation tests

- **HardwareChangeInvalidatesCache**: call `setDisplayValues` to populate
  the cache, verify the getter returns cached value, simulate a
  PhysicalDevice per-property emit on the selected device, verify the
  getter now returns the live session value instead of the cached one.
- **ProfileReloadRestoresCache**: after a hardware change invalidates
  the cache, call `setDisplayValues` again; getter should return the
  new cached value (confirms `setDisplayValues` re-arms the cache).
- **UnselectedDeviceDoesNotInvalidateCache**: cache invalidation is
  scoped to the selected device. A hardware change on a non-selected
  mouse must NOT invalidate the cache.

### Scroll-pair coupling

`scrollHiRes` and `scrollInvert` share `scrollConfigChanged`. Test:

- **ScrollConfigChangeEmitsOnce**: one PhysicalDevice
  `scrollConfigChanged` emission produces exactly one DeviceModel
  `scrollConfigChanged` emission (not two), but both `scrollHiRes` and
  `scrollInvert` Q_PROPERTYs return the new value via
  `property("scrollHiRes")` / `property("scrollInvert")`.

### Emit-site tests in `tests/test_device_session.cpp`

For any newly-added DeviceSession emit (likely `currentDPIChanged` and
`thumbWheelInvertChanged`):

- **SetDpiEmitsCurrentDPIChanged**: a connected session, `setDPI(value)`
  calls through the command queue and `currentDPIChanged` fires exactly
  once when the ack arrives. (Follow the existing `setSmartShift`
  pattern from this file.)
- **SetThumbWheelInvertEmitsChanged**: analogous.

These are narrow tests; they verify the signal exists and fires, not
that the HID++ wire is correct.

### Test count

Expected growth: about 10 new test cases. All 539 core + 72 QML must
stay green.

## Rollout

Single PR on branch `fix-stale-property-notifys`. Five commit groups:

1. `feat(device-session): emit currentDPIChanged and thumbWheelInvertChanged` — add missing emit points + tests.
2. `feat(physical-device): relay per-property session signals` — new PhysicalDevice signals + expanded `connectSessionSignals` lambdas.
3. `fix(device-model): invalidate display cache on live hardware change` — in the per-property handlers (added in the next commit), set `m_hasDisplayValues = false` on the selected device. Own commit so the cache-invalidation rule is reviewable in isolation; tested against the `setDisplayValues` round-trip.
4. `feat(device-model): emit per-property notifications gated on selection` — handler lambdas in `addPhysicalDevice`, the `thumbWheelInvertChanged` signal declaration, the QSignalSpy tests.
5. `feat(device-model): flip Q_PROPERTY NOTIFY to per-property signals` — the header edits. Must land last so QML bindings only flip to the new NOTIFYs after the emit sites exist.

Commits 3 and 4 touch the same handler lambdas. Land them as separate commits by staging the handler skeleton in commit 3 (cache invalidation only, no emits) and extending it in commit 4 (add the emits). Reviewers see two reviewable diffs: "the handler invalidates the cache" vs "the handler also emits NOTIFYs".

No separate release tag. Lands incidentally in whatever beta comes next.

## Known risks

- **Double-emit on profile reload.** Today `settingsReloaded` fires on
  profile reload and drives all these properties. After the flip, those
  properties no longer listen to `settingsReloaded`, so profile reload
  must also emit the per-property signals. Update `setDisplayValues`
  (the only site that changes `m_display*` in bulk) to emit the
  corresponding per-property signals: `currentDPIChanged`,
  `smartShiftEnabledChanged`, `smartShiftThresholdChanged`,
  `scrollConfigChanged`, `thumbWheelModeChanged`. Audit the four
  existing `settingsReloaded` emit sites in `DeviceModel.cpp` (lines
  122, 208, 232, 245, 666); only `setDisplayValues` and
  `refreshFromActiveDevice` need per-property companions. Tests must
  cover profile reload as a path too.
- **Signal storms on rapid hardware changes.** A chattering physical
  button or a DPI ramp could pulse Q_PROPERTY NOTIFYs in quick
  succession. QML bindings are debounced by the event loop; not an
  actual problem but worth mentioning. The existing
  `refreshRow`/`stateChanged` chain already fires at the same rate
  with no observed issue.

## Out of scope

- `activeSlot` / Easy-Switch host staleness. Same class of bug but
  defer to MX Vertical tester feedback before expanding.
- Any change to the HID++ capability tables.
- `QSortFilterProxyModel` or other ActionModel filtering (issue #63).
